# News Portal

This is a second year project which I worked in a team to create. The task was to create an online portal that used freely available web services. As a group we decided to use News APIs and thus this code shows the methodology we used in getting the JSON objects and displaying the applicable data all on the front-end. 

This code was also written in XHTML 1.1 Strict and is fully validated.
