## Problem Specification

A Web Portal is an all-in-one website. It is a single point of access to information. It brings information together from diverse but related sources, making their access quicker, easy and convenient. It combines information from different sources into a single user interface. For example https://my.in.gov is a governmental portal and http://www.newsnow.co.uk is a news portal. Some portals allow users to personalise their content.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate that you are able to create a richly interactive web portal using web services (APIs), web programming (PHP or Python), CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript (JS), JS libraries, AJAX and databases (MySQL).
=======
This is a second year project which I worked in a team to create. The task was to create an online portal that used freely available web services. As a group we decided to use News APIs and thus this code shows the methodology we used in getting the JSON objects and displaying the applicable data all on the front-end. 

This code was also written in XHTML 1.1 Strict and is fully validated.
