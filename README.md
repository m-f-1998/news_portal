## Problem Specification

A Web Portal is an all-in-one website. It is a single point of access to information. It brings information together from diverse but related sources, making their access quicker, easy and convenient. It combines information from different sources into a single user interface. For example https://my.in.gov is a governmental portal and http://www.newsnow.co.uk is a news portal. Some portals allow users to personalise their content.
